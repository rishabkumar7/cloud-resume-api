Welcome to the Cloud Resume API Challenge. A project where you will have the opportunity to build and deploy a serverless API using different Cloud providers (of your choice), integrated with GitHub Actions for CI/CD. The primary goal? Construct an API that can serve resume data in JSON format.

## Challenge Objective 🎯

Your task is to create a Serverless function that fetches resume data stored in a NoSQL Database and return it in JSON format. To level up the challenge, integrate GitHub Actions to automatically deploy updates to your Cloud Serverless function whenever you push to your repository.

## Key Requirements

- NoSQL Database: Containing sample resume data.
- Serverless Function: Fetch and return resume data.
- GitHub Actions: Automatically package and deploy your serverless on every push to the repository.

## Getting Started 🚀
